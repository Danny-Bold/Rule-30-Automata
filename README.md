Rule 30 is a cellular automata that has been proven to exhibit chaotic behaviour. This is in opposition to most of the other 127 automata, which exhibit periodic, regular patterns.

The automata looks at the three cells above the current cell (directly above, one left and one right) and determines the colour of the current cell based on the colours of those cells.

Once the current row has been generated, the automaton moves to the next row.

This project generates images produced by Rule 30, and gives the flexibility to change the automaton to another set of rules quickly.
